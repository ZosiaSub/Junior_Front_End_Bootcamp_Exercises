                <h1>About me...</h1>
                <p>Am an ambitious person who is always looking for new challenges. In my life I am always inspired by other people. They give me strength and determination to achieve my goals. They are opening new horizons for me, show new ideas. The most important values for me are family, faith and development. For this I base my actions. Life is running very fast, so I do not waste my time on unimportant things, I always try to focus on priorities. I share my time between family and own development. My activity with children and sport is my recipe for rest after work. My hobby is riding a horse, running, badminton, ice skating and skiing. I love peace and quiet places, the sea, the forest and the lake. I am a cat and dog lover. I am most satisfied with the overcoming of my weaknesses and development myself. I take difficult tasks and do my best to accomplish them in 100%. I like contact with people and teamwork. In five years I want to be a versatile programmer. Currently I'm starting an adventure with programming, and I think I am discovering new passion... :)
